As a Data Analyst, I love transforming raw data into actionable insights, and this dashboard truly brings that to life. Here's what I've explored:

Understanding User Behavior:
 Visualizing peak listening hours and days with interactive heatmaps. When are people tuning in the most?
Content Performance Over Time: Tracking trends for Albums, Artists, and Tracks played year-over-year, alongside clear comparisons to previous periods. See which content is gaining momentum!
Top Content Discovery: Highlighting the Top 5 Albums, Artists, and Tracks to quickly identify audience favorites.
Granular Detail: Diving into individual track and album performance, including average listening time, to understand engagement at a micro-level.
